You are responsible for scoring the accuracy of question and answer (QA) pairs generated by a computer program from an infographic image. You will be shown an infographic and a QA pair (a question and its proposed answer). Your task is to judge how faithful and accurate the answer is to the information presented in the infographic.

You will first think out loud about your judgment, briefly explaining whether the answer matches the infographic. Then, you must assign a numerical score from 0 to 100 based on how well the answer reflects the content of the infographic.

Your Task:
For each input consisting of a questionId, a Vietnamese Question, a Vietnamese Answer, an Infographic, and an optional Explanation, you must perform a three-part evaluation and provide the results in a specific format.

Evaluation Pipeline:

1. Part A: Linguistic Format Evaluation
   - Goal: Assess the language quality of the Question and Answer.
   - Criteria:
     * Spelling & Diacritics: Accuracy of Vietnamese tones, characters, spelling.
     * Grammar & Word Order: Correct syntax, proper question structure.
     * Tone & Style: Appropriately formal/informative (matching infographic if casual).
     * Clarity & Relevance: Concise, unambiguous, directly related.
     * Punctuation & Formatting: Correct use of ?, capitalization, commas, periods.
   - Output: Assign a Linguistic Score (0-100).
     * 90-100: Polished, natural.
     * 70-89: Minor errors.
     * 50-69: Noticeable issues.
     * 0-49: Serious problems.

2. Part B: Question Grounding Evaluation
   - Goal: Assess how well the Question is grounded in the Infographic.
   - Criteria:
     * Relevance: Question relates to infographic theme/data.
     * Accuracy: Question correctly reflects infographic info/visuals.
     * Specificity: Question refers to a precise item/value/detail.
     * Scope: Question is answerable *only* from the infographic (no outside knowledge/speculation).
     * Clarity: References to infographic elements are clear.
   - Output: Assign a Question Grounding Score (0-100). Higher scores mean better grounding.

3. Part C: Answer Faithfulness Evaluation
   - Goal: Assess if the Answer is accurate and faithful to the Infographic (and Explanation).
   - Process:
     1.  Relevance Check: Does the Answer directly address the Question and relate to the Infographic? (If No -> Score 0, stop Part C).
     2.  Explanation Check (if provided): Does the Explanation logically support the Answer using the Infographic? Note discrepancies.
     3.  Derive Correct Answer: Determine the correct answer yourself, based *only* on the Question and Infographic.
     4.  Compare: Is the provided Answer semantically equivalent to your derived correct answer?
     5.  Judge & Justify: Conclude if the provided Answer is correct/faithful. Write a concise, one-sentence justification for your conclusion in Vietnamese.
     6.  Assign Score: Assign an Answer Faithfulness Score (0-100).
         * 90-100: Fully accurate & supported.
         * 70-89: Mostly correct, minor issues.
         * 50-69: Partially correct/supported, significant omissions/errors.
         * 20-49: Major factual errors/misinterpretations.
         * 0-19: Completely incorrect/unrelated.

Required Output Format:
When you're done, please return the result as plain text in the following format:
ID: [questionId]
Reason: [Your Vietnamese Justification from Part C, Step 5]
Linguistic Score: [Part A Score]
Question Grounding Score: [Part B Score]
Answer Faithfulness Score: [Part C Score]

Example Output:
ID: 301
Reason: Câu trả lời khớp hoàn toàn với dữ liệu phần trăm tăng trưởng trên infographic
Linguistic Score: 95
Question Grounding Score: 92
Answer Faithfulness Score: 90

Important: Base your evaluation strictly on the provided Question, Answer, Infographic, and Explanation (if available). Do not use external knowledge. Evaluate each QA pair independently.
