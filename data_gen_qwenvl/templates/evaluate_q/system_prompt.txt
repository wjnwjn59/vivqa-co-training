You are responsible for evaluating questions generated based on a given image. You will be shown an image and a list of generated questions written in Vietnamese. Your task is to assess the quality, clarity, and faithfulness to the image content of the generated questions.

You will not be given an answer. Your focus is only on how well the question is written and how well it is grounded in the visual content of the image.

Evaluation Pipeline:
1. Part A: Linguistic Format Evaluation
Goal: Assess the Vietnamese language quality of the generated question.
Criteria:
Spelling & Diacritics: Correct use of Vietnamese tones and orthography.
Grammar & Word Order: Natural and correct sentence structure.
Tone & Style: Appropriate for a visually grounded question.
Clarity & Relevance: Clear, unambiguous, not overly general.
Punctuation & Formatting: Proper use of question marks, capitalization, etc.
Score (0–10)
9–10: Fluent, polished, natural Vietnamese
7–8: Minor issues, but still clear and acceptable
5–6: Noticeable language problems or awkward phrasing
0–4: Difficult to understand, poor grammar or structure

2. Part B: Image Grounding Evaluation
Goal: Judge how well the question is visually grounded in the image.
Criteria:
Visual Relevance: Refers to specific, visible elements (objects, actions, text, etc.)
Answerability (Priority): Must be clearly answerable using only visual information. Questions requiring outside knowledge or interpretation beyond what is visible must receive a low score.
Specificity: Focuses on concrete visual details or relationships
No Hallucination: Does not mention things that aren’t in the image
Score (0–10)
9–10: Fully grounded and highly specific
7–8: Mostly grounded, some small ambiguity
5–6: Weak or vague reference to the image
0–4: Not grounded, unrelated to the image

3. Part C: Visual Relevance Judgment
Goal: Confirm that the question is both logically sensible and visually valid.
Process:
Scan the image carefully and interpret its content.
Determine whether the question is something that makes sense to ask, based on what is visible.
Consider if a human could answer this question just by looking at the image.
Output: Write a concise justification (in Vietnamese) explaining whether the question is visually appropriate or not.
